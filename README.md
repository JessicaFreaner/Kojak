Final project within the Metis Bootcamp. Given full control over the design, implementation and presentation of the data science project, I worked to identify early signals of gentrification in NYC by looking at peopleâ€™s voluntary movements through the city. In other words, can you gleam insights into emerging destinations by looking at where people go for fun?

INSIGHT: I can look at MTA turnstile data during BRUNCH (Saturday & Sunday) and NIGHTLIFE (Friday & Saturday) for voluntary travel!!!

To accomplish the task, I harvested and combined data (MTA turnstile, Station Geocodes, Property Values, GeoJSONs, Inflation Adjuster) from a variety of sources (e.g., [web scraped urls, wget for page content](http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html "MTA turnstile data"), [Github repositories](https://github.com/chriswhong/nycturnstiles "station geocodes"), [extracted data from D3 viz](http://youarehere.cc/#/maps/by-city/new_york "MIT Media Labs's YouAreHere Project"), [OpenNYC](https://nycopendata.socrata.com/ "Neightborhood Boundaries"), [Wolfram Alpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com/ "Wolfram Alpha")). [All original data uploaded in respective folders].

Set up remote MySQL server on [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/ "Digital Ocean") allowing me to perform hours long SQL joins on the cloud while sleeping [SQL setup commands in SQL setup folder]. Mapped subway stations and property values to neighborhood polygons. Adjusted property values for inflation. Performed extensive data cleaning, filtering, and aggregation to create exploratory D3 interactive visualization [d3 folder contains html, images, and final jsons].
