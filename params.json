{"name":"Kojak","tagline":"Exploring NYC's Moving Populations","body":"# Kojak - Exploring NYC's Moving Populations\r\n\r\nFinal project within the Metis Bootcamp. Given full control over the design, implementation and presentation of the data science project, I worked to identify early signals of gentrification in NYC by looking at peopleâ€™s voluntary movements through the city. In other words, can you gleam insights into emerging destinations by looking at where people go for fun?\r\n\r\nINSIGHT: I can look at MTA turnstile data during BRUNCH (Saturday & Sunday) and NIGHTLIFE (Friday & Saturday) for voluntary travel!!!\r\n\r\nTO accomplish the task, I harvested and combined data (MTA turnstile, Station Geocodes, Property Values, GeoJSONs, Inflation Adjuster) from a variety of sources (e.g., [web scraped urls, wget for page content](http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html \"MTA turnstile data\"), [Github repositories](https://github.com/chriswhong/nycturnstiles \"station geocodes\"), [extracted data from D3 viz](http://youarehere.cc/#/maps/by-city/new_york \"MIT Media Labs's YouAreHere Project\"), [OpenNYC](https://nycopendata.socrata.com/ \"Neightborhood Boundaries\"), [Wolfram Alpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com/ \"Wolfram Alpha\")). [All original data uploaded in respective folders].\r\n\r\nSet up remote MySQL server on [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/ \"Digital Ocean\") allowing me to perform hours long SQL joins on the cloud while sleeping [SQL setup commands in SQL setup folder]. Mapped subway stations and property values to neighborhood polygons. Adjusted property values for inflation. Performed extensive data cleaning, filtering, and aggregation to create exploratory D3 interactive visualization [d3 folder contains html, images, and final jsons]. \r\n\r\nEasily consumable presentation of project uploaded as PDF in Presentation Folder.\r\n\r\n##Other Metis Projects:\r\n[Benson](http://jessicafreaner.github.io/Benson/ \"Exploring MTA Data\")\r\n[Luther](http://jessicafreaner.github.io/Luther/ \"Exploring Movie Data\")\r\n[McNulty](http://jessicafreaner.github.io/McNulty/ \"Exploring Heart Health Data\")\r\n[Fletcher](http://jessicafreaner.github.io/Fletcher/ \"Exploring Data with NLP\")\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
